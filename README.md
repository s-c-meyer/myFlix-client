#  Meyer's Movies :movie_camera: :film_strip: 

## Description

Meyer's Movies is a single page application that pulls data about movies from a database using a [REST API that I built](https://github.com/s-c-meyer/myFlix). User's can create a profile to save their favorite movies, and click to learn more about each movie in the database.


### Notable Features
- Create a profile to save your favorite movies and view them in the profile view
- Search the database of movies using the search bar
- Learn more about a specific movie by clicking into it, including movie genre, director, and description. 

## Tech Stack 

This application was built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), and using Parcel as the build tool.
